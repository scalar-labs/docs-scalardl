# Configure a custom values file for ScalarDL Auditor

This document explains how to create your custom values file for the ScalarDL Auditor chart. If you want to know the details of the parameters, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/scalar-labs/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/scalardl-audit/README.md) of the ScalarDL Auditor chart.

## Required configurations

### Scalar Envoy configurations

You must set the Scalar Envoy configurations in the custom values file for ScalarDL Auditor. This is because client requests are sent to ScalarDL Auditor via Scalar Envoy as the load balancer of gRPC requests if you deploy ScalarDL Auditor on a Kubernetes environment.

Please refer to the document [Configure a custom values file for Scalar Envoy](configure-custom-values-envoy.mdx) for more details on the Scalar Envoy configurations.

```yaml
envoy:
  configurationsForScalarEnvoy: 
    ...

auditor:
  configurationsForScalarDLAuditor: 
    ...
```

### Image configurations

You must set `auditor.image.repository`. Be sure to specify the ScalarDL Auditor container image so that you can pull the image from the container repository.

```yaml
auditor:
  image:
    repository: <SCALARDL_AUDITOR_CONTAINER_IMAGE>
```

For more details on the container repository for Scalar products, see [How to get the container images of Scalar products](../scalar-kubernetes/HowToGetContainerImages.mdx).

### Auditor/Database configurations

You must set `auditor.auditorProperties`. Please set your `auditor.properties` to this parameter. Please refer to the [auditor.properties](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalar/blob/master/auditor/conf/auditor.properties) for more details on the configuration of ScalarDL Auditor.

```yaml
auditor:
  auditorProperties: |
    scalar.db.contact_points=localhost
    scalar.db.username=cassandra
    scalar.db.password=cassandra
    scalar.db.storage=cassandra
    scalar.dl.auditor.ledger.host=<Host name to access ScalarDL Ledger pods>
    scalar.dl.auditor.private_key_path=/keys/auditor-key-file
    scalar.dl.auditor.cert_path=/keys/auditor-cert-file
```

### Key/Certificate configurations

You must set a private key file to `scalar.dl.auditor.private_key_path` and a certificate file to `scalar.dl.auditor.cert_path`.

You must also mount the private key file and the certificate file on the ScalarDL Auditor pod.

For more details on how to mount the private key file and the certificate file, refer to [Mount key and certificate files on a pod in ScalarDL Helm Charts](mount-files-or-volumes-on-scalar-pods.mdx#mount-key-and-certificate-files-on-a-pod-in-scalardl-helm-charts).

## Optional configurations

### Resource configurations (Recommended in the production environment)

If you want to control pod resources using the requests and limits of Kubernetes, you can use `auditor.resources`.

Note that the resources for one pod of Scalar products are limited to 2vCPU / 4GB memory from the perspective of the commercial license. Also, when you get the pay-as-you-go containers provided from AWS Marketplace, you cannot run those containers with more than 2vCPU / 4GB memory configuration in the `resources.limits`. When you exceed this limitation, pods are automatically stopped.

You can configure them using the same syntax as the requests and limits of Kubernetes. So, please refer to the official document [Resource Management for Pods and Containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for more details on the requests and limits of Kubernetes.

```yaml
auditor:
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 4Gi
    limits:
      cpu: 2000m
      memory: 4Gi
```

### Secret configurations

If you want to use environment variables to set some properties (e.g., credentials) in the `auditor.auditorProperties`, you can use `auditor.secretName` to specify the Secret resource that includes some credentials.

For example, you can set credentials for a backend database (`scalar.db.username` and `scalar.db.password`) using environment variables, which makes your pods more secure.

Please refer to the document [How to use Secret resources to pass the credentials as the environment variables into the properties file](use-secret-for-credentials.mdx) for more details on how to use a Secret resource.

```yaml
auditor:
  secretName: "auditor-credentials-secret"
```

### Affinity configurations (Recommended in the production environment)

If you want to control pod deployment using the affinity and anti-affinity of Kubernetes, you can use `auditor.affinity`.

You can configure them using the same syntax as the affinity of Kubernetes. So, please refer to the official document [Assigning Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/) for more details on the affinity configuration of Kubernetes.

```yaml
auditor:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        - podAffinityTerm:
            labelSelector:
              matchExpressions:
                - key: app.kubernetes.io/name
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - scalardl-audit
                - key: app.kubernetes.io/app
                  operator: In
                  values:
                    - auditor
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
          weight: 50
```

### Prometheus/Grafana configurations (Recommended in the production environment)

If you want to monitor ScalarDL Auditor pods using [kube-prometheus-stack](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack), you can deploy a ConfigMap, a ServiceMonitor, and a PrometheusRule resource for kube-prometheus-stack using `auditor.grafanaDashboard.enabled`, `auditor.serviceMonitor.enabled`, and `auditor.prometheusRule.enabled`.

```yaml
auditor:
  grafanaDashboard:
    enabled: true
    namespace: monitoring
  serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    namespace: monitoring
    interval: 15s
  prometheusRule:
    enabled: true
    namespace: monitoring
```

### SecurityContext configurations (Default value is recommended)

If you want to set SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext for ScalarDL Auditor pods, you can use `auditor.securityContext` and `auditor.podSecurityContext`.

You can configure them using the same syntax as SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext of Kubernetes. So, please refer to the official document [Configure a Security Context for a Pod or Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) for more details on the SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext configurations of Kubernetes.

```yaml
auditor:
  podSecurityContext:
    seccompProfile:
      type: RuntimeDefault
  securityContext:
    capabilities:
      drop:
        - ALL
    runAsNonRoot: true
    allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
```

### TLS configurations (optional based on your environment)

You can enable TLS in:

- The communications between the ScalarDL Auditor and clients.
- The communications between the ScalarDL Ledger and ScalarDL Auditor.

In addition, you have several options for certificate management. For more details, see [TLS configurations for Envoy](./configure-custom-values-envoy.mdx#tls-configurations-optional-based-on-your-environment).

You should consider which method you use based on your security requirements. For guidance and related documentation for each method, refer to the following decision tree:  

```mermaid

  A[Do you want to use <br /><a href='https://cert-manager.io/docs/'>cert-manager</a> to manage your <br />private key and certificate <br />files automatically?]
  A -->|Yes, I want to manage my <br />certificates automatically.| B
  A -->|No, I want to manage my <br />certificates manually by myself.| C

  B -->|I want to use a <br />trusted CA.| E
  C -->|I want to use a <br />self-signed CA.| F
  C -->|I want to use a <br />trusted CA.| G

  E[See the <a href='#use-a-trusted-ca-with-cert-manager-to-manage-your-private-key-and-certificate-files'>Use a trusted <br />CA with cert-manager to <br />manage private key and <br />certificate files</a> section.]
  F[See the <a href='#use-your-private-key-and-certificate-files'>Use your private <br />key and certificate files</a> <br />section, and use the self-signed <br />certificate you generated.]
  G[See the <a href='#use-your-private-key-and-certificate-files'>Use your private key <br />and certificate files</a> section, <br />and use the trusted certificate <br />generated by the third party.]
```

#### Enable TLS

You can enable TLS in all ScalarDL Auditor connections by using the following configurations:

```yaml
auditor:
  auditorProperties: |
    ...(omit)...
    scalar.dl.auditor.server.tls.enabled=true
    scalar.dl.auditor.server.tls.cert_chain_path=/tls/scalardl-auditor/certs/tls.crt
    scalar.dl.auditor.server.tls.private_key_path=/tls/scalardl-auditor/certs/tls.key
    scalar.dl.auditor.tls.enabled=true
    scalar.dl.auditor.tls.ca_root_cert_path=/tls/scalardl-ledger/certs/ca.crt
    scalar.dl.auditor.tls.override_authority=envoy.scalar.example.com
  tls:
    enabled: true
```

##### Use your private key and certificate files

You can set your private key and certificate files by using the following configurations:

```yaml
auditor:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    caRootCertSecret: "scalardl-auditor-tls-ca"
    certChainSecret: "scalardl-auditor-tls-cert"
    privateKeySecret: "scalardl-auditor-tls-key"
```

In this case, you have to create secret resources that include private key and certificate files for ScalarDL Ledger and ScalarDL Auditor as follows, replacing the contents in the angle brackets as described:

```console
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-ca --from-file=ca.crt=/<PATH_TO_YOUR_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_AUDITOR> -n <NAMESPACE>
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-cert --from-file=tls.crt=/<PATH_TO_YOUR_CERTIFICATE_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_AUDITOR> -n <NAMESPACE>
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-key --from-file=tls.key=/<PATH_TO_YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_AUDITOR> -n <NAMESPACE>
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-ca-for-ledger --from-file=ca.crt=/<PATH_TO_YOUR_CA_CERTIFICATE_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_LEDGER> -n <NAMESPACE>
```

For more details on how to prepare private key and certificate files, see [How to create private key and certificate files for Scalar products](../scalar-kubernetes/HowToCreateKeyAndCertificateFiles.mdx).

##### Use a trusted CA with cert-manager to manage your private key and certificate files

You can manage your private key and certificate files with cert-manager by using the following configurations, replacing the content in the angle brackets as described:

:::note

* If you want to use cert-manager, you must deploy cert-manager and prepare the `Issuers` resource. For details, see the cert-manager documentation, [Installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) and [Issuer Configuration](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/).
* By default, Scalar Helm Chart creates a `Certificate` resource that satisfies the certificate requirements of Scalar products. The default certificate configuration is recommended, but if you use a custom certificate configuration, you must satisfy the certificate requirements of Scalar products. For details, see [How to create private key and certificate files for Scalar products](../scalar-kubernetes/HowToCreateKeyAndCertificateFiles.mdx#certificate-requirements).

:::

```yaml
auditor:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certManager:
      enabled: true
      issuerRef:
        name: <YOUR_TRUSTED_CA>
      dnsNames:
        - auditor.scalardl.example.com
```

In this case, cert-manager issues your private key and certificate files by using your trusted issuer. You don't need to mount private key and certificate files manually.

##### Use a self-signed CA with cert-manager to manage your private key and certificate files

You can manage your private key and self-signed certificate files with cert-manager by using the following configurations:

:::note

* If you want to use cert-manager, you must deploy cert-manager. For details, see the cert-manager documentation, [Installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
* By default, Scalar Helm Chart creates a `Certificate` resource that satisfies the certificate requirements of Scalar products. The default certificate configuration is recommended, but if you use a custom certificate configuration, you must satisfy the certificate requirements of Scalar products. For details, see [How to create private key and certificate files for Scalar products](../scalar-kubernetes/HowToCreateKeyAndCertificateFiles.mdx#certificate-requirements).

:::

```yaml
auditor:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    certManager:
      enabled: true
      selfSigned:
        enabled: true
      dnsNames:
        - auditor.scalardl.example.com
```

In this case, Scalar Helm Charts and cert-manager issue your private key and self-signed certificate files. You don't need to mount private key and certificate files manually.

#### Set a root CA certificate for ScalarDL Ledger

If you enable TLS on the ScalarDL Ledger side, you must set a root CA certificate file for Envoy in front of ScalarDL Ledger to access it from ScalarDL Auditor. To determine which approach you should take, refer to the following decision tree:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A[Are you using <a href='https://cert-manager.io/docs/'>cert-manager</a>?]
  A -->|Yes| B
  A -->|No| D
  B[Are you using a <a href='#use-a-self-signed-ca-with-cert-manager-to-manage-your-private-key-and-certificate-files'>self-signed CA with cert-manager</a>?]
  B -->|No| C[Are you using the same <a href='#use-a-trusted-ca-with-cert-manager-to-manage-your-private-key-and-certificate-files'>trusted CA</a> for ScalarDL <br />Ledger and ScalarDL Auditor with cert-manager?]
  C -->|No| D[You must set the root <br />CA certificate of Envoy for ScalarDL Ledger manually.]
  C ---->|Yes| E[Scalar Helm Chart automatically sets the root CA certificate. You <br />don't need to set `auditor.tls.upstream.caRootCertSecret` explicitly.]
```

If you need to set the root CA certificate file of Envoy manually, you can set it by using the following configurations:

```yaml
auditor:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    caRootCertForLedgerSecret: "scalardl-auditor-tls-ca-for-ledger"
```

In this case, you have to create secret resources that include root CA certificate files as follows, replacing the contents in the angle brackets as described:

```console
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-ca-for-ledger --from-file=ca.crt=/<PATH_TO_ROOT_CA_CERT_FILE_FOR_ENVOY_IN_FRONT_OF_SCALARDL_LEDGER>/scalardl-ledger -n <NAMESPACE>
```

##### Set custom authority for TLS communications

You can set the custom authority for TLS communications by using `auditor.tls.overrideAuthority`. This value doesn't change what host is actually connected. This value is intended for testing but may safely be used outside of tests as an alternative to DNS overrides. For example, you can specify the hostname presented in the certificate chain file that you set by using `auditor.tls.certChainSecret`. This chart uses this value for `startupProbe` and `livenessProbe`.

##### Set a root CA certificate for Prometheus Operator

If you set `auditor.serviceMonitor.enabled=true` and `auditor.tls.enabled=true` (in other words, if you monitor ScalarDL Auditor with TLS configuration by using Prometheus Operator), you must set the secret name to `auditor.tls.caRootCertSecretForServiceMonitor`.

```yaml
auditor:
  tls:
    enabled: true
    caRootCertSecretForServiceMonitor: "scalardl-auditor-tls-ca-for-prometheus"
```

In this case, you have to create secret resources that include a root CA certificate for ScalarDL Auditor in the same namespace as Prometheus as follows:

```console
kubectl create secret generic scalardl-auditor-tls-ca-for-prometheus --from-file=ca.crt=/path/to/your/ca/certificate/file -n <NAMESPACE_SAME_AS_PROMETHEUS>
```

### Replica configurations (Optional based on your environment)

You can specify the number of replicas (pods) of ScalarDL Auditor using `auditor.replicaCount`.

```yaml
auditor:
  replicaCount: 3
```

### Logging configurations (Optional based on your environment)

If you want to change the log level of ScalarDL Auditor, you can use `auditor.scalarAuditorConfiguration.auditorLogLevel`.

```yaml
auditor:
  scalarAuditorConfiguration:
    auditorLogLevel: INFO
```

### Taint and toleration configurations (Optional based on your environment)

If you want to control pod deployment by using the taints and tolerations in Kubernetes, you can use `auditor.tolerations`.

You can configure taints and tolerations by using the same syntax as the tolerations in Kubernetes. For details on configuring tolerations in Kubernetes, see the official Kubernetes documentation [Taints and Tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/).

```yaml
auditor:
  tolerations:
    - effect: NoSchedule
      key: scalar-labs.com/dedicated-node
      operator: Equal
      value: scalardl-auditor
```
