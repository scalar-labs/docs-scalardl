This guide explains how to scale ScalarDB.

:::note

You might be able to resolve some performance issues by scaling ScalarDB Cluster if a bottleneck exists on the ScalarDB Cluster side. However, sometimes a performance issue is caused by a bottleneck in the backend databases. In such cases, scaling ScalarDB Cluster will not resolve the performance issue. 

Instead, please check where the bottleneck exists. If the bottleneck exists in the backend databases, consider scaling the backend databases.

        If you use [Scalar Helm Chart](https://github.com/scalar-labs/helm-charts) to deploy ScalarDB Cluster, you can scale your ScalarDB Cluster deployment as follows:

        1. Add the following to your custom values file, replacing `<NUMBER_OF_PODS>` with the number of pods you want to scale:

           ```yaml
           scalardbCluster:
             replicaCount: <NUMBER_OF_PODS>
           ```

        1. Upgrade your ScalarDB Cluster deployment by running the following `helm upgrade` command, which uses the updated custom values file. Be sure to replace the contents in the angle brackets as described:

           ```console
           helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> scalar-labs/scalardb-cluster -n <NAMESPACE> -f /<PATH_TO_YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUES_FILE_FOR_SCALARDB_CLUSTER> --version <CHART_VERSION>
           ```

        If you deploy ScalarDB Cluster in a Kubernetes environment, you can temporarily scale your ScalarDB Cluster deployment by using the `kubectl scale` command.

        1. Run the following `kubectl scale` command, replacing the contents in the angle brackets as described:

        ```console
        kubectl scale --replicas=<NUMBER_OF_PODS> deployment/<DEPLOYMENT_RESOURCE_NAME_OF_SCALARDB_CLUSTER>
        ```

    ScalarDB Core is provided as a Java library. So, when you scale your application, ScalarDB scales with your application.
