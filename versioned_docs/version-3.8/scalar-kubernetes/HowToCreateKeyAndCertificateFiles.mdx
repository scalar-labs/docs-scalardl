# How to Create Private Key and Certificate Files for Scalar Products

This guide explains how to create private key and certificate files for Scalar products.

## Private key and certificate files for TLS connections

ScalarDB Cluster and ScalarDL support TLS for each connection. When you enable the TLS feature, you must prepare private key and certificate files.

### Certificate requirements

* You can use only `RSA` or `ECDSA` as an algorithm for private key and certificate files.

### Example steps to create sample private key and certificate files

In this example, you'll create sample private key and certificate files by using `cfssl` and `cfssljson`. If you don't have those tools installed, please install `cfssl` and `cfssljson` to run this example.

:::note

* You can use other tools, like `openssl`, to create the private key and certificate files. Alternatively, you can ask a third-party CA or the administrator of your private CA to create the private key and certificate for your production environment.
* This example creates a self-signed certificate. However, it is strongly recommended that these certificates **not** be used in production. Please ask trusted issuers (a public CA or your private CA) to create certificate files for your production environment based on your security requirements.

:::

1. Create a working directory.

   ```console
   mkdir -p ${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/
   ```

1. Change the working directory to `${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/`.

   ```console
   cd ${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/
   ```

1. Create a JSON file that includes CA information.

   ```console
   cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/ca.json
   {
       "CN": "scalar-example-ca",
       "key": {
           "algo": "ecdsa",
           "size": 256
       },
       "names": [
           {
               "C": "JP",
               "ST": "Tokyo",
               "L": "Shinjuku",
               "O": "Scalar Example CA"
           }
       ]
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Create the CA private key and certificate files.

   ```console
   cfssl gencert -initca ca.json | cfssljson -bare ca
   ```

1. Create a JSON file that includes CA configurations.

   ```console
   cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/ca-config.json
   {
       "signing": {
           "default": {
               "expiry": "87600h"
           },
           "profiles": {
               "scalar-example-ca": {
                   "expiry": "87600h",
                   "usages": [
                       "signing",
                       "key encipherment",
                       "server auth"
                   ]
               }
           }
       }
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Create a JSON file that includes server information.

   ```console
   cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalar/example/certs/server.json
   {
       "CN": "scalar-example-server",
       "hosts": [
           "server.scalar.example.com",
           "localhost"
       ],
       "key": {
           "algo": "ecdsa",
           "size": 256
       },
       "names": [
           {
               "C": "JP",
               "ST": "Tokyo",
               "L": "Shinjuku",
               "O": "Scalar Example Server"
           }
       ]
   }
   EOF
   ```

1. Create the private key and certificate files for the server.

   ```console
   cfssl gencert -ca ca.pem -ca-key ca-key.pem -config ca-config.json -profile scalar-example-ca server.json | cfssljson -bare server
   ```

1. Confirm that the private key and certificate files were created.

   ```console
   ls -1
   ```

   [Command execution result]

   ```console
   ca-config.json
   ca-key.pem
   ca.csr
   ca.json
   ca.pem
   server-key.pem
   server.csr
   server.json
   server.pem
   ```

   In this case:

   * `server-key.pem` is the private key file.
   * `server.pem` is the certificate file.
   * `ca.pem` is the root CA certificate file.

## Private key and certificate files for `digital-signature` authentication (ScalarDL)

ScalarDL has several kinds of authentication methods. If you use `digital-signature` as an authentication method, you must prepare private key and certificate files. For more details on the authentication method, see [ScalarDL Authentication Guide](https://scalardl.scalar-labs.com/docs/latest/authentication/).

### Certificate requirements

* You must use `ECDSA` as an algorithm of private key and certificate files.
* You must use `P-256` as a curve parameter.
* You must use `SHA256` as a hash function.

### Example steps to create sample private key and certificate files

You can create sample private key and certificate files by using [`cfssl` and `cfssljson`](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl). Please install `cfssl` and `cfssljson` first if you don't install them yet.

:::note

* You can use other tools, like `openssl`, to create the private key and certificate files. Alternatively, you can ask a third-party CA or the administrator of your private CA to create the private key and certificate for your production environment.
* This example creates a self-signed certificate. However, it is strongly recommended that these certificates **not** be used in production. Please ask trusted issuers (a public CA or your private CA) to create certificate files for your production environment based on your security requirements.
