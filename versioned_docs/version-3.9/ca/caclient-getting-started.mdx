# How to Get a Certificate

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This document describes how to get a certificate to enroll in ScalarDL.

ScalarDL has several kinds of authentication methods. If you use `digital-signature` as the authentication method, you must prepare private key and certificate files. For more details on authentication methods, see [ScalarDL Authentication Guide](../authentication.mdx).

## Private key and certificate requirements

If you use [`digital-signature`](../authentication.mdx#digital-signatures) as the authentication method, you must create a private key and certificate that satisfy the following requirements:

- `SEC1` or `PKCS#8` key
- `ECDSA` as the algorithm
- `P-256` as the curve parameter
- `SHA256` as the hash function

:::note

ScalarDL does not check the expiration date of certificates. So, you can set any expiration dates to certificates that ScalarDL uses.

    You can create a self-signed certificate as follows:

:::note

This example creates a `SEC1` key.

        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

        You must install the [cfssl and cfssljson](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) command-line tools for the following steps.

        <h3>Create a local CA</h3>

        1. Create a working directory.

           ```console
           mkdir -p ${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/
           ```

        1. Change the working directory to `${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/`.

           ```console
           cd ${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/
           ```

        1. Create a JSON file that includes CA information.

           ```console
           cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/ca.json
           {
               "CN": "scalardl-example-ca",
               "key": {
                   "algo": "ecdsa",
                   "size": 256
               },
               "names": [
                   {
                       "C": "JP",
                       "ST": "Tokyo",
                       "L": "Shinjuku",
                       "O": "ScalarDL Example CA"
                   }
               ]
           }
           EOF
           ```

        1. Create the CA private key and certificate files.

           ```console
           cfssl gencert -initca ca.json | cfssljson -bare ca
           ```

        1. Create a JSON file that includes CA configurations.

           ```console
           cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/ca-config.json
           {
               "signing": {
                   "default": {
                       "expiry": "87600h"
                   },
                   "profiles": {
                       "scalardl-example-ca": {
                           "expiry": "87600h",
                           "usages": [
                               "signing",
                               "key encipherment",
                               "server auth"
                           ]
                       }
                   }
               }
           }
           EOF
           ```

        <h3>Create a private key and certificate for each component</h3>

        <Tabs groupId="components" queryString>
          <TabItem value="scalardl-ledger" label="ScalarDL Ledger" default>
          1. Create a JSON file that includes ScalarDL Ledger information.

             ```console
             cat << 'EOF' > ${HOME}/scalardl/digital-signature/certs/ledger.json
             {
                 "CN": "scalardl-ledger",
                 "hosts": [
                     "ledger.scalardl.example.com",
                     "localhost"
                 ],
                 "key": {
                     "algo": "ecdsa",
                     "size": 256
                 },
                 "names": [
                     {
                         "C": "JP",

                         "O": "ScalarDL Ledger Example"
                     }
                 ]
             }
             EOF
             ```

          1. Create the private key and certificate files for ScalarDL Ledger.

             ```console
             cfssl gencert -ca ca.pem -ca-key ca-key.pem -config ca-config.json -profile scalardl-example-ca ledger.json | cfssljson -bare ledger
             ```

          1. Confirm that the private key and certificate files were created.

             ```console
             ls -1
             ```

             You should see the following output:

             ```console
             ca-config.json
             ca-key.pem
             ca.csr

             In this case:

             - `ledger-key.pem` is the private key file for ScalarDL Ledger.
             - `ledger.pem` is the certificate file for ScalarDL Ledger.

    You can ask your [CFSSL server](./caserver-getting-started.mdx) to create a certificate file.

    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    You must install the [cfssl and cfssljson](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl) command-line tools for the following steps.

    <h3>Create a private key and certificate file</h3>

    1. Create a private key and CSR based on the [requirements](#private-key-and-certificate-requirements) by using a tool such as CFSSL or OpenSSL. You can see an example of how to create a private key and CSR by using the `cfssl` command in the [CFSSL](?methods=self-signed&tools=cfssl) tab or the `openssl` command in the [OpenSSL](?methods=self-signed&tools=openssl) tab.

    1. Request a certificate from your CFSSL server.

       :::note

       - The `-remote` option is needed to specify the CFSSL server endpoint URI.
       - The `-bare` option for cfssljson is needed to specify a prefix for the output key files.
