# How to Scale ScalarDL

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

This guide explains how to scale ScalarDL. The contents of this guide assume that you used [Scalar Helm Chart](https://github.com/scalar-labs/helm-charts) to deploy ScalarDL, which is the recommended way.

:::note

You might be able to resolve some performance issues by scaling ScalarDL if a bottleneck exists on the ScalarDL side. However, sometimes a performance issue is caused by a bottleneck in the backend databases. In such cases, scaling ScalarDL will not resolve the performance issue. 

Instead, please check where the bottleneck exists. If the bottleneck exists in the backend databases, consider scaling the backend databases.

<Tabs groupId="components" queryString>
  <TabItem value="scalardl-ledger" label="ScalarDL Ledger" default>

  1. Add the following to your custom values file, replacing `<NUMBER_OF_PODS>` with the number of pods you want to scale:

     ```yaml
     ledger:
       replicaCount: <NUMBER_OF_PODS>
     ```

  1. Upgrade your ScalarDL Ledger deployment by running the following `helm upgrade` command, which uses the updated custom values file. Be sure to replace the contents in the angle brackets as described:

     ```console
     helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> scalar-labs/scalardl -n <NAMESPACE> -f /<PATH_TO_YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUES_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_LEDGER> --version <CHART_VERSION>
     ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="scalardl-auditor" label="ScalarDL Auditor" default>

  1. Add the following to your custom values file, replacing `<NUMBER_OF_PODS>` with the number of pods you want to scale:

     ```yaml
     auditor:
       replicaCount: <NUMBER_OF_PODS>
     ```

  1. Upgrade your ScalarDL Auditor deployment by running the following `helm upgrade` command, which uses the updated custom values file. Be sure to replace the contents in the angle brackets as described:

     ```console
     helm upgrade <RELEASE_NAME> scalar-labs/scalardl-audit -n <NAMESPACE> -f /<PATH_TO_YOUR_CUSTOM_VALUES_FILE_FOR_SCALARDL_AUDITOR> --version <CHART_VERSION>
     ```
