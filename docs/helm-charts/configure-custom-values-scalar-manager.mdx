# Configure a custom values file for Scalar Manager

This document explains how to create your custom values file for the Scalar Manager chart. If you want to know the details of the parameters, please refer to the [README](https://github.com/scalar-labs/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/scalar-manager/README.md) of the Scalar Manager chart.

## Required configurations

### Service configurations

You must set `service.type` to specify the Service resource type of Kubernetes. If you want to use a load balancer provided by could providers, you need to set `service.type` to `LoadBalancer`.

```yaml
service:
  type: LoadBalancer
```

### Image configurations

You must set `api.image.repository` and `web.image.repository`. Be sure to specify the Scalar Manager container image so that you can pull the image from the container repository.

```yaml
api:
  image:
    repository: <SCALAR_MANAGER_API_IMAGE>
web:
  image:
    repository: <SCALAR_MANAGER_WEB_IMAGE>
```
