# Getting Started with Helm Charts (Scalar Manager)

Scalar Manager is a centralized management and monitoring solution for ScalarDB and ScalarDL within Kubernetes cluster environments that allows you to:

* Check the availability of ScalarDB or ScalarDL.
* Schedule or execute pausing jobs that create transactionally consistent periods in the databases used by ScalarDB or ScalarDL.
* Check the time-series metrics and logs of ScalarDB or ScalarDL through Grafana dashboards.

For more details, refer to [Scalar Manager Overview](../scalar-manager/overview.mdx).

This guide will show you how to deploy and access Scalar Manager on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Assumption

This guide assumes that you are aware of how to deploy ScalarDB or ScalarDL with the [monitoring](getting-started-monitoring.mdx) and [logging](getting-started-logging.mdx) tools to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirement

* You must deploy `kube-prometheus-stack` according to the instructions in [Getting Started with Helm Charts (Monitoring using Prometheus Operator)](getting-started-monitoring.mdx).
* You must deploy `loki-stack` according to the instructions in [Getting Started with Helm Charts (Logging using Loki Stack)](getting-started-logging.mdx).

## What we create

We will deploy the following components on a Kubernetes cluster as follows.

## Step 1. Upgrade the `kube-prometheus-stack` to allow Grafana to be embedded

1. Add or revise this value to the custom values file (e.g. scalar-prometheus-custom-values.yaml) of the `kube-prometheus-stack`
   ```yaml
   kubeStateMetrics:
     enabled: true
   nodeExporter:
     enabled: true
   kubelet:
     enabled: true
   grafana:
     grafana.ini:
       users:
         default_theme: light
       security:
         allow_embedding: true
       auth.anonymous:
         enabled: true
         org_name: "Main Org."
         org_role: Editor
   ```

1. Upgrade the Helm installation
   ```console
   helm upgrade scalar-monitoring prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -n monitoring -f scalar-prometheus-custom-values.yaml
   ```

## Step 2. Prepare a custom values file for Scalar Manager

1. Create an empty .yaml file named `scalar-manager-custom-values.yaml` for `scalar-manager`.

1. Set the service type to access Scalar Manager. The default value is `ClusterIP`, but if we access using the `minikube tunnel` command or some load balancer, we can set it as `LoadBalancer`.
   ```yaml
   service:
     type: LoadBalancer
     port: 8000
   ```

## Step 3. Deploy `scalar-manager`

1. Deploy the `scalar-manager` Helm Chart.
   ```console
   helm install scalar-manager scalar-labs/scalar-manager -f scalar-manager-custom-values.yaml
   ```

## Step 4. Access Scalar Manager

### If you use minikube

1. To expose Scalar Manager's service resource as your `localhost (127.0.0.1)`, open another terminal, and run the `minikube tunnel` command.
   ```console
   minikube tunnel
   ```

1. Open the browser with URL `http://localhost:8000`

### If you use other Kubernetes than minikube

If you're using a Kubernetes cluster other than minikube, you'll need to access the `LoadBalancer` service according to the manner of each Kubernetes cluster. For example, you'll need to use a load balancer provided by your cloud services provider or use the `kubectl port-forward` command.

:::note

Scalar Manager will try to detect the external IP of Grafana and then embed Grafana based on the IP. Therefore, you must configure the Grafana service type as `LoadBalancer`, and the external IP must be accessible from your browser.

:::

## Step 5. Delete Scalar Manager
1. Uninstall `scalar-manager`
   ```console
   helm uninstall scalar-manager
   ```
