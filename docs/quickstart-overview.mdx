# Quickstart Overview

In this category, you can follow quickstart tutorials for how to get started with ScalarDL.

ScalarDL offers two abstracted data stores for easy, seamless interaction with the ledger: HashStore and TableStore.

* HashStore provides interfaces for ensuring the authenticity of objects and collections, making it ideal for chain-of-custody and similar applications.
* TableStore offers an SQL-compatible interface for verifying table authenticity, enabling developers to build versatile, tamper-evident applications with familiar data models and interfaces.

To get started, refer to the following guides:

* [Get Started with ScalarDL HashStore](getting-started-hashstore.mdx)
* [Get Started with ScalarDL TableStore](getting-started-tablestore.mdx)

ScalarDL also includes primitive interfaces for more customized interactions with the ledger. To explore this approach, see [Get Started with ScalarDL Ledger](getting-started.mdx).
